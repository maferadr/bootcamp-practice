# Personal Portfolio - Maria Angulo
As an emergent developer, I've created a personal portfolio that lays out my knowledge building HTML and CSS code from the scratch, making use of CSS selectors, flexbox and box model as well as hover styles making reference to pseudo classes and pseudo elements.

## Header and Navbar Navigation Section
Deploys the sections that the portfolio offers to the User, as well as a presentation picture of the developer that have created it, in that way the user can have an idea about who's heading towards him.

## About ME and Sidebar Section
Offers a brief Developer's introduction about why and how this path career has been taking by her, oferring some pictures than can help the user navigate into it through some GUI.

## Activities Section
Deploys 3 sections inside of it: Soft Skills telling the user about how the developer interacts with people and her environment and how she develops herself towards it; Development Experience explaining about what languages she knows to develop so far; At the end she deployed her Career Goals in where briefly explains what she expects at learning coding.
